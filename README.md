# Lamba

A in-development functional programming language.

This project is mainly my attempt at learning how a functional language works and how to write a compiler for one. It is heavily in development and there are no working programs yet.

### Aims

* Easy to understand, well-documented compiler
* Generate LLVM or Java Bytecode
* Clear error messages

### The Lamba Language

Lamba is a pure, functional programming language. It is going to (roughly) support the following features:

* Type inferencing
* Defining algebraic (sum) datatypes
* Pattern matching
* Decent standard library
* Laziness
* Polymorphism

Example programs can be found in the testprograms folder.

### TODO
* Disallow defining the same function multiple times



#### TODO codegenerator
1. Decide on string representation
2. Decide on tuple representation
3. Decide on list representation
4. Implement failing match code
5. Implement code generation for string/tuple/list
6. Implement
